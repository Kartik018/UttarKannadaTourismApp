# UttarKannadaTourismApp
The ultimate goal of the project is to explore the requirements of travelers in Uttar Kannada and our proposed and developed solution of android application including some basic guidance for the travelers. Every year lakhs of travelers from diverse places come to visit Uttar Kannada for different purposes. Most of them come for religious, study, and business purposes. Besides, tourists also visit different places of natural beauty and the history of the districts. However, the travelers face different types of problems including limited transportation information, problems in understanding the Kannada language, and so on. Based on travelers’ requirements,  I have tried to come up with my online mobile application which can solve their problems during visiting tourist places of Uttar Kannada. The report illustrates the features, development method, result, and uses of our android application named “Uttar Kannada Tourism”.
